### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your Wemo devices within HomeKit. The plugin:
  - does not require your Wemo credentials as uses local network discovery (SSDP) and local control
  - will attempt to control your devices via a local HTTP request
  - will attempt to establish a UPnP connection to your devices to listen for external changes (if disabled, HTTP polling is used)

### Prerequisites

- To use this plugin, you will need to already have:
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org): latest version of `v16`, `v18` or `v20` - any other major version is not supported.
  - [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io): `v1.6` - refer to link for more information and installation instructions.
  - For the UPnP connection, make sure your Homebridge instance has an allocated IP from the same IP network or VLAN as your Wemo devices. Otherwise, you should disable the UPnP connection to avoid connection errors.
