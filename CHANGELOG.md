  - These deprecated settings have their own section in the plugin UI
- Clean up the plugin-ui by removing unnecessary descriptions

### Fixed

- Fixes a bug when initialising Garage Doors

## 2.10.0 (2021-01-30)

### Added

- New configuration option `mode` to choose between:
  - `mode: "auto"` the plugin will auto-discover devices **and** configure manual devices (default if option not set)
  - `mode: "manual"` the plugin will **only** configure manual devices
- Support for the Wemo Outdoor Plug
- [Experimental] Automatic port scan for manual devices
  - Use a full address `http://192.168.1.X:49153/setup.xml` as before to fully configure a manual device

- Set a custom `noMotionTimer` per Wemo motion device (NetCam/Motion Sensor)
  - If this is not configured then the plugin will continue to use the global `noMotionTimer` setting per motion device
  - If the global setting is not configured then the plugin will use the default of 60 seconds
- Cumulative `TotalConsumption` for Insight devices
  - This changes the current method of resetting each day
  - This can be reverted back to resetting each day in the plugin settings with the `showTodayTC` config option
- Set a custom `wattDiff` (wattage difference) for Insight devices - the plugin will not log consecutive wattage updates if the difference from the previous is less than this value (default: `0`)

### Changed

- `discoveryInterval` now needs a minimum value of `15` and discovery cannot be disabled
  - Existing configurations with lower value will be disregarded and `15` will be used
  - The option of disabling the discovery interval has been removed as this interval is essential for correcting connection issues for all your Wemo devices
- Logging for manual devices that cause errors when loading (e.g. IP/port change)
- More consistent and clearer error logging
- Updated plugin-ui-utils dep and use new method to get cached accessories
