## 4.1.0 (2021-08-10)

### Added

- **New Mode: `semi`**
  - This mode will attempt to auto discover the devices you have configured in the settings and will ignore any discovered devices that aren't configured. This mode will also initialise manual devices you have configured.
  - In this mode, the plugin will skip the discovery process whilst all devices have been found and haven't reported an error
- **UPnP & HTTP Polling Options**
  - Global option to disable UPnP
    - UPnP offers real-time notifications to the plugin on external changes, but can be problematic if your devices are on a different ip network or VLAN to your Homebridge instance
    - HTTP Polling will be used if UPnP has been disabled
  - Option to override choice of UPnP or HTTP polling per device
  - HTTP polling interval configuration option
- **All Devices**
  - A log warning and a hap error when controlling a device before it has been initially discovered
- **Wemo Links**
  - New configuration section for Wemo Links, with options to manually specify an IP/URL and ignore the device (+ all subdevices)

### Changed

- **UPnP & HTTP Polling**
  - Controlling a device will be attempted regardless of the UPnP connection status if the plugin has cached IP and port info
  - When the UPnP connection fails and reconnects, the plugin will no longer reinitialise the device as new. Instead, the subscriptions will restart with any updated IP and port information.
  - UPnP subscription `setTimeout`s will be cancelled on Homebridge shutdown event
  - Plugin will now properly unsubscribe from UPnP events on Homebridge shutdown event
- **Manual Mode**
  - In `manual` mode, the plugin will skip the discovery process whilst all devices have been found and haven't reported an error
- **Logging**
  - The dreaded `awaiting (re)connection` repeated message has been removed
    - The plugin will continue to repeatedly log any devices that are awaiting initial discovery on plugin startup
    - If an already-discovered device reports a HTTP/UPnP error in due course, the plugin will log the error **once**, and log again when the connection has been re-established
- **Wemo Dimmers**
  - Some newer models of the Wemo Dimmer maybe don't support UPnP?
    - The plugin will no longer automatically HTTP poll newer versions of these dimmer devices
    - To re-enable the polling, set up an entry for your device in the configuration and change the 'Listener Type' to 'HTTP'
- **Wemo Crockpot**
  - The polling interval will now adhere to the global 'Polling Interval' setting (rather than hard-coded 30 seconds)
- **Backend**
  - Discovery increment count now resets from 3 to 0 to avoid manipulating large numbers over time
  - Reduced UPnP subscription time from 150 to 120 seconds
  - Some code refactoring

### Fixed

- **Wemo Dimmers**
  - When turning on, the plugin requests an updated brightness value, which if fails, will no longer affect the outcome of the original switch-on request

### Deprecated

- Manual devices configuration section
  - Please start to move any entries you have from the manual devices section to the appropriate device section
  - Any entries in the manual devices section will continue to work (ie this is not a breaking change)

## 4.0.0 (2021-07-29)

### Added

- **Configuration**
  - Plugin will now check for duplicate device ID entries in the config and ignore them

### Changed

- ⚠️ **Platform Versions**
  - Recommended node version bumped to v14.17.4
  - Recommended homebridge version bumped to v1.3.4

### Removed

- ⚠️ `ignoredDevices[]` configuration entry
  - Devices can be ignored by entering a serial number in the relevant device section and ticking 'Hide From HomeKit'
  - It is recommended to set up your ignored devices **before** updating to avoid losing your list of serial numbers

## 3.4.2 (2021-07-27)

### Fixed

- An issue preventing Wemo Outlets being exposed as `Switch` or `AirPurifier` types

  - `overrideLogging` setting per device type (to replace the removed `overrideDisabledLogging`), which can be set to (and will override the global device logging and debug logging settings):

  - `mode: "manual"` the plugin will **only** configure manual devices
- Support for the Wemo Outdoor Plug
- [Experimental] Automatic port scan for manual devices
  - Use a full address `http://192.168.1.X:49153/setup.xml` as before to fully configure a manual device

- Set a custom `noMotionTimer` per Wemo motion device (NetCam/Motion Sensor)
  - If this is not configured then the plugin will continue to use the global `noMotionTimer` setting per motion device

  - This can be reverted back to resetting each day in the plugin settings with the `showTodayTC` config option
- Set a custom `wattDiff` (wattage difference) for Insight devices - the plugin will not log consecutive wattage updates if the difference from the previous is less than this value (default: `0`)

### Changed

- `discoveryInterval` now needs a minimum value of `15` and discovery cannot be disabled
  - Existing configurations with lower value will be disregarded and `15` will be used
